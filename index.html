        <h6>Hi Mom! -N. Armstrong</h6>
        <p style="text-indent: 0;">American Neil Armstrong has become the first man to walk on the Moon.</p>
        <p>The astronaut stepped onto the Moon's surface, in the Sea of Tranquility, at 0256 GMT, nearly 20 minutes after first opening the hatch on the Eagle landing craft.</p>
        <p>Armstrong had earlier reported the lunar module's safe landing at 2017 GMT with the words: "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."</p>
        <p>As he put his left foot down first Armstrong declared: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</p>
        <p>He described the surface as being like powdered charcoal and the landing craft left a crater about a foot deep.</p>
        <h3>'We came in peace'</h3>
        <div class="dave">
            <p>The historic moments were captured on television cameras installed on the Eagle and turned on by Armstrong.</p>
            <p>Armstrong spent his first few minutes on the Moon taking photographs and soil samples in case the mission had to be aborted suddenly.</p>
            <p>He was joined by colleague Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin at 0315 GMT and the two collected data and performed various exercises - including jumping across the landscape - before planting the Stars and Stripes flag at 0341 GMT.</p>
            <p>They also unveiled a plaque bearing President Nixon's signature and an inscription reading: "Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind."</p>
            <p>After filming their experience with a portable television camera the astronauts received a message from the US President.</p>
            <p>President Nixon, in the White House, spoke of the pride of the American people and said: "This certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made."</p>
            <p>Many other nations - including the UK - sent messages of congratulation. Moscow Radio announced the news solemnly in its 1030 GMT broadcast.</p>
            <p>As Aldrin and Armstrong collected samples, Michael Collins told mission control in Houston he had successfully orbited the Moon in the mother ship Columbia, and take-off was on schedule for 1750 GMT this evening.</p>

            <p>After re-joining the Columbia mothership the astronauts - including Collins - left the Moon's orbit on 22 July and returned to Earth on 24 July.</p>
